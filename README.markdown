# ImageUtility


### Overview
Images - be they business logos or user avatars - are increasingly important in business software, however generally speaking business software is significantly behind the curve of what social networks in particular have been able to do. One of the reasons why this is so challenging is that business software doesn't have images as a core part of its value proposition the way that social software does, however, the benefits of having avatars and an easy ability to upload and customize images is an important, if utility function of the business web software.

This project is a web tool where a user can upload a picture/logo and have it resized so that it fits within the confines of what a business web application can support.
